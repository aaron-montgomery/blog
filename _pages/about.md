Hi! I'm Aaron Montgomery, an Associate Professor at [Baldwin Wallace University](https://www.bw.edu/). I received a PhD in Mathematics (specializing in Probability Theory) in 2013 at the University of Oregon under the direction of [David Levin](https://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dlevin/). Since then I have been a member of the BW Mathematics and Statistics faculty, and starting in Fall 2022 I will be the coordinator of the new Data Science and Data Analytics programs.

You can reach me at `amontgom` (atsymbol) `bw.edu`.
